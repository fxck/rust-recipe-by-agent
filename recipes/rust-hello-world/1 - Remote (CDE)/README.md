# Rust Hello World - Remote (CDE)
This is a remote development environment for [Rust Hello World (info + deploy)](https://app.zerops.io/recipes/rust-hello-world?environment=remote-cde) recipe on [Zerops](https://zerops.io).

<!-- #ZEROPS_EXTRACT_START:intro# -->
Remote development environment for human developers — no local Rust toolchain needed. The `appdev` container runs the `dev` setup with full source code and Cargo registry deployed, ready for `cargo run` immediately after SSH login. Mount it in VS Code Remote SSH or JetBrains Gateway for a full IDE experience. The `appstage` container runs the `prod` setup for validating release builds before promotion.
