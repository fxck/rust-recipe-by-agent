# Rust Hello World - Highly-available Production
This is the highly-available production environment for [Rust Hello World (info + deploy)](https://app.zerops.io/recipes/rust-hello-world?environment=highly-available-production) recipe on [Zerops](https://zerops.io).

<!-- #ZEROPS_EXTRACT_START:intro# -->
Enterprise-grade deployment with Serious core (dedicated physical CPUs), multiple Rust containers with dedicated vCPUs, and a highly-available PostgreSQL cluster (primary + replica with automatic failover). Rust's zero-overhead abstractions and lack of garbage collection make it particularly well-suited for dedicated CPU environments — consistent sub-millisecond response times without GC pauses or JIT warmup periods.
