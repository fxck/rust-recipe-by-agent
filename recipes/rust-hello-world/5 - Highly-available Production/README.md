# Rust Hello World - Highly-available Production
This is a highly-available production environment for [Rust Hello World (info + deploy)](https://app.zerops.io/recipes/rust-hello-world?environment=highly-available-production) recipe on [Zerops](https://zerops.io).

<!-- #ZEROPS_EXTRACT_START:intro# -->
Enterprise-grade production environment with the Serious project core, dedicated CPUs, and HA PostgreSQL replication. Two app containers run with dedicated CPU time for consistent low-latency performance. The HA database runs two containers with synchronous replication — one failure causes no data loss or downtime.
